,12 healthy snacks with 200 calories or less
" Many people reach for a snack or two in between meals. Snacking is fine, just be sure to choose lower-calorie options. The key is to have some , ready when hunger hits. Instead of a 3-ounce (85 g) bag of flavored tortilla chips (425 calories), choose a cup (250 mg) of air-popped popcorn (31 calories), a cup (250 mg) of grapes and a low-fat cheese stick (180 calories) or a small apple and 12 almonds (160 calories). Choosing healthy snacks twice a day will save you 500 calories., Try to nix one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more. To burn another 150 calories take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner., One 12-ounce (355 mL) regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce (475 mL) flavored latte can pack 250 or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce (475 mL) serving. A couple of sweet drinks a day can easily add up to 500 calories or more. Choose water, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full., Taking a second helping can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table. Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen. Or, if you still do not feel satisfied, add a second helping of vegetables, fruit, or salad., Substitute lower-calorie options for some of your high-calorie favorites. For example, if a recipe calls for a cup (250 mL) of sour cream (444 calories) or heavy cream (821 calories), use plain low-fat yogurt instead (154 calories)., The , at most restaurants are much larger than recommended serving sizes. Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal. You can also share an entrée with a friend, or make a meal out of an appetizer and a large salad. Just be sure to go easy on the dressing and high calorie toppings., Frying food adds lots of unhealthy calories and saturated fat to any dish. Instead of fried chicken or fish, choose grilled, broiled, or poached instead. And skip the French fries. A large serving of fries alone can add almost 500 calories to a meal. Instead, see if you can substitute for the vegetable of the day or a side salad., Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead. You will save a little over 500 calories., Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to. This is especially true if you are sitting in front of the TV. You may be surprised to learn that a large bag of chips will run more than 1000 calories. Instead, place one portion in a bowl, and put the rest away., Cutting back on alcohol is an easy way for many people to trim ,. Alcohol does not have any nutritional value, so when you imbibe (drink) alcohol, you are getting empty calories, up to 500 for some mixed drinks made with syrupy sweeteners, fruit juices, and ice cream or heavy cream. If you do order a drink, choose a 12-ounce (355 mL) light beer (103 calories) or a 5-ounce (145 mL) glass of wine (120 calories). ",10 ways to cut 500 calories a day

" You do not need to do all 30 minutes of exercise at one time. You can get the same health benefits from doing three 10-minute sessions, or two 15-minute workouts. For example, you could do 10 minutes of squats and push-ups in the morning, take a brisk 10-minute walk after lunch, then play a round of hoops with the kids after dinner., DO NOT struggle to do an exercise you do not like. There are endless ways to get moving. Keep trying until you find ,. Then keep mixing it up., If possible, bike, walk, or jog to and from work. You may find you feel less stressed and have more energy when you arrive. Plus, you will save money by not having to pay for parking, gas, or bus fare., A morning workout can boost your energy for the rest of the day. So set your alarm in the morning for 30 minutes earlier. Walk or jog around the neighborhood, or use a stationary bike or treadmill indoors., While a.m. exercise may be a great way to start the day, if you are not a morning person, it may feel like a chore. Instead, try exercising at lunchtime or after work., Make getting exercise just as important as your other appointments. Set aside time in your daily planner. No one needs to know what you are doing. They just need to know that you are not available during that time. Also, no matter what type of exercise you do, try to do it at the same time every day. This helps make it part of your routine. For example, you might swim after work every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Or you could take a walk after dinner every weeknight., Softball, basketball, hockey, and soccer are not just for kids. Look for recreational teams in your community. Most leagues are open to all skill levels. So do not worry if you have not played before. Joining a team can make exercise more fun and help keep you motivated., Use TV time to exercise. You can stretch, jog in place, jump rope, use resistance bands, or use a bike trainer while you watch your favorite TV shows., Your co-workers likely face the same struggles to exercise as you do. Get together with like-minded folks at work to walk or jog at lunch or after work., If you regularly meet a friend for coffee or lunch, think about making it an activity date instead. Take a walk or a hike, go bowling, or try a new exercise class together. Many people find exercising with a friend more fun., Working with a trainer can help teach you new ways to exercise and keep you motivated. Just make sure to ask about the trainer's qualifications. He or she should have an exercise certification from a national organization, such as the American College of Sports Medicine. Many gyms offer group training, which can help cut the cost., Plan weekly outings with your children that include exercise. Go bicycling, take a nature walk, or go swimming. Or, sign up for an exercise class for parents and children. ",Make time to move

Certain fibers, such as wheat bran, and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb) can bind with calcium and prevent it from being absorbed.

Most of your baby's calories should still come from breast milk or formula.,Breast milk is not a good source of iron. So after 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet.

Start by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.,You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in her mouth.,You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas, and peaches.,Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits.

They will eat smaller amounts at a time, but will eat more often (4 to 6 times a day). Having snacks on hand is a good idea.,At this age, their growing slows. They will not double in size like they did when they were an infant. ,If your child dislikes a new food, try giving it again later. Often it takes several tries for children to take to new foods.,DO NOT give your child sweets or sweetened beverages. They can spoil their appetite and cause tooth decay.,Avoid salt, strong spices, and caffeine products, including soft drinks, coffee, tea, and chocolate.,If your baby is fussy, they may need attention, rather than food. ,After your child turns 2, your child's diet should be moderately low in fat.

" The muscles in your back and legs do extra work when you stand. To burn even more calories, pace back and forth while you talk on the phone. If you have a desk job, see if you can get a standing desk, or rig one up, and spend part of the day standing while you work., People who often take breaks from sitting burn more calories than people who sit in one place for hours on end. Just getting up for a quick stretch will break up your sitting time., Walk to the bathroom on the other end of the building. Park at the far end of the parking lot. Get off the bus or subway several stops ahead and walk the rest of the way. Always be on the lookout for ways you can add more walking to your life., While standing, lift one foot an inch (2.5 centimeters) off the ground, see how long you can hold that position, then change feet. You will work your leg muscles, core muscles, and improve your balance., This is another great exercise for balance. See if you can put on your sock, shoe, and tie your shoe without letting your foot touch the ground., Walking fast burns more calories than a slow stroll. Make a game out of seeing how quickly you can get to your destination., If you have to get to the 11th floor, walk up as many flights as you can, then take the elevator the rest of the way. Stair climbing is one of the easiest activities you can do to burn calories without going to a gym., If you have guests over for a BBQ or dinner party, start the evening with a game of volleyball, badminton, or an active video game. Make social events active by meeting to go bowling, throw darts, or play pool., Wearable activity monitors can tell you how active you have been on a given day. You might set a daily goal for yourself, or get a friend to join you in a friendly competition. Seeing how adding extra activities add to your daily results can inspire you to do even more., Listening to music while you walk can make the activity more fun and take your mind off what you are doing. Pick an upbeat tune, and you may find you up the intensity without realizing it., Television remains one of the biggest draws for sitting marathons. If you are hooked on a certain show, tune in and then hit the off button as soon as your show ends. You could also try standing up while you watch or doing pushups, crunches, or squats every time a commercial comes on. Only allowing yourself to watch your favorite show at the gym can help motivate you to get in your workouts., When you physically go to a store to shop, you walk to the building, take the stairs, walk the aisles, reach for things, and lift and carry bags. Compare that to the tiny movements involved in online shopping., Prepackaged foods, snow blowers, riding mowers and other conveniences are all great time-saving inventions. But as things get easier, it gets harder to balance the calories you eat with the energy you use. Cooking from scratch, cutting the grass with a push mower, and shoveling the walk all make you move. And the more you move, the more you burn, and the healthier you will be. ",Ways to burn more calories every day
