Choosing healthy snacks twice a day will save you 500 calories.", " Try to nix one high-calorie food item each day. Whether it is a donut in the morning, a brownie or bag of chips at lunch, or chocolate cake after dinner, you will save 250 to 350 calories or more. To burn another 150 calories take a 40-minute brisk walk after lunch or dinner.", " One 12-ounce (355 mL) regular soda has about 150 calories, and a 16-ounce (475 mL) flavored latte can pack 250 or more. Even fruit smoothies have lots of calories, as many as 400 in a 16-ounce (475 mL) serving. A couple of sweet drinks a day can easily add up to 500 calories or more. Choose water, sparkling water, or black coffee or tea instead and save your calories for foods that will help you feel full.", " Taking a second helping can add up to unwanted calories. It is easy to keep filling your plate when you serve food family style on the table. Instead, fill your plate once and keep extras in the kitchen.

Instead of cleaning your whole plate, ask the server to put half in a container for you to take home for another meal.

Just be sure to go easy on the dressing and high calorie toppings.", " Frying food adds lots of unhealthy calories and saturated fat to any dish.

Instead, see if you can substitute for the vegetable of the day or a side salad.", " Skip the meat toppings, extra cheese, and deep-dish crust, and have a couple slices of thin-crust vegetable pizza instead. You will save a little over 500 calories.", " Eat all food from a plate or bowl, including snacks. When you snack out of a bag or box, it is easy to eat more than you intend to.
